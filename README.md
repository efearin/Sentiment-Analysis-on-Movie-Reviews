Sentiment Analysis on The Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews

The Rotten Tomatoes is one of the biggest movie databases with users’ personal reviews and the project aims to rate movies on the site by just looking at these written reviews of the related movies as one of the following five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive.
Dataset has sentences from The Rotten Tomato and the phrases created by these sentences by using the Stanford parser with their related id’s. 
In general deep learning for sentiment analysis techniques -which are mostly focuses on isolated words- will be used on dataset.
Sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity are some of the obstacles of the sentiment-analysis of this project.
